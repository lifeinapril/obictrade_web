</b><br>
<v>
ObicTrade believes in providing excellent service and strives to be sincere and transparent in its
approach to customer service. Your confidence in us is of paramount importance to us and we would
never place our personal growth before your interest.
<br>
This Policy aims to minimize instances of customer complaints, grievances, and disputes through a
channelized approach of review and redress. Your feedback will help us in identifying shortcomings
in our product features and service delivery. Your satisfaction is our main objective in our quest to
build a healthy customer relationship and deliver excellent service.
<br>
ObicTrade has developed a procedure for the prompt attention to the grievances of its customers
with respect to various issues by setting up a “customer support” and “a dispute resolution
mechanism”.
<br>
The following are the foundational principles of this policy:
</v><br><br>
<b>
Transparency;
</b><br>
<v>
Prompt, courteous and timeous response to all queries, enquiries, and complaints; and
Constantly developing new and smarter mechanisms to receive and address customer grievances.
The details of the dispute resolution mechanism are placed in the domain of public knowledge.
A dispute may occur as a result of several reasons. It may be because of the difference in the service
expected and the service delivered. A dispute may also arise as a result of technical or non-technical
errors in the system or at times due to human inadvertence or error.
<br>
ObicTrade provides a user-friendly platform to all its customers to file a complaint/ share feedback if
they are disappointed by the services rendered. Customers can give their complaint/ feedback in
sending an email to hello@obictrade.com
<br>
If the user’s grievance is not resolved within the stipulated time frame, or if the user is not
completely satisfied with the solution provided by ObicTrade, then they can approach our dispute
resolution system with their complaint or explore other legal avenues available for dispute
resolution.
<br>
To make ObicTrade&#39;s dispute resolution system more meaningful and effective, a structured system
has been put in place. This system will ensure that the complaints are redressed seamlessly and well
within the stipulated time frame.
<br>
Expertise of staff in handling complaints
<br>
Our staff undergo regular training to ensure that consumers&#39; queries and grievances are handled
properly.
<br>
They are trained to work in a manner that enhances consumer trust and confidence in us. Our
objective to achieve maximum customer satisfaction can be witnessed in both the operations as well
as in customer communications.
<br>
We analyse consumer queries and complaints and ensure the removal of such complaints from the
root. This helps in improving the overall quality of the service levels gradually.
<br>
Introduction to our Dispute Resolution System
<br>
The users’ experience is our focus and this is why we devote ourselves to listen to our users and take
their concerns seriously.
<br>
We positively analyze and scrutinize how you would feel from the time you make requests for our
services till the time you’re done to evolve and enhance our services.
